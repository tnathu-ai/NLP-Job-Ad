    "## The Dataset\n",
    "Same as in the previous activity, the document collection that we are going to use is the BBC News Dataset. For the origin of the dataset, please refer to [here](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html)\n",
    "To be brief, the dataset consists of 2225 documents from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas, i.e., class Labels (business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, instead of using the raw dataset, we will utilised the pre-processed clean dataset we saved in our previous Activity 3 Generating Feature Vectors.\n",
    "Recall that at the end of Activity 3, we saved the pre-processed articles in a txt file named `bbcNews.txt`, where, each row is a document, with tokens seperated by whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continue, please make sure you have the following files in the same folder as this jupyter notebook:\n",
    "* `bbcNews.txt`: contains the pre-process BBC news articles\n",
    "* `labels.csv`: contains the label/class of each article."

    "Alright! so we have the document embedding vector representation for each article now, we can proceed to the task of document classification. \n",

    "\n",
    "One way to confirm that the feature space we are using is representative enough for our task (classifying articles into separate labels) to be solvable is to use dimensionality-reduction techniques: These methods project a high-dimensional vector into a lower number of dimensions, with different guarantees on this projection according to the method used. \n",

    "* features, a numpy array of document embeddings, each for an article.\n",

    "and projects the feature/document embedding vectors in a 2 dimension space and plot them out. \n",

    "1. get the set of classes, called `categories` (5 categories)\n",
    "2. sample 30% of the data/document embeddings randomly, and record the indices selected\n",
    "3. project the selected document embeddings in 2 dimensional space using tSNE, each document embedding now corresponds to a 2 dimensional vector in `projected_features`\n",

    "\n",
    "Ok, I hope you have lots of fun building document embeddings based on varoius word embedding models. \n",
    "Previously, when we generate the document embeddings, we just sum up the embeddings vector of each tokenized word in the article, a bit simplicity 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, let's make it a bit more challenging, we are going to build the tf-idfdocument embeddings. \n",
    "What does that mean? 🤨\n",
    "Hmm~~ it's not magic, we just do a weigthed sum of the word embedding vectors, however, the weight here, refers to the tf-idfweight of the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you already forgot about what is `tf-ijob_ad`, please refer to Activity 3 Pre-processing Text and Generating Features. \n",
    "Otherwise, move on!\n",
    "So we've generated the tf-idfvector representation of documents in Activity 3 and saved in a txt file called `bbcNews_tVector.txt`. The format of this file is:\n",
    "- each line represents an article;\n",
    "- each line is of the format 'w_index:weight w_index:weight ......' \n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, but we don't have that word index `w_index` here in this activity, what should we do? 🤔\n",
    "ah ha, we also saved the vocabulary in a file `vocab`, in which each line is a word, and of the format `index,word`. \n",
    "Theresore, based on these two files, we can create a word:weight mapping for each tokenized word in a document!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, in the following couple block of codes, this is exactly what we are trying to do, step by step. \n",
    "- the `gen_vocIndex` function reads the the vocabulary file, and create an w_index:word dictionary"
