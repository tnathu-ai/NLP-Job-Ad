    "Same as in the previous activity, the document collection that we are going to use is the BBC News Dataset. For the origin of the dataset, please refer to [here](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html)\n",
    "To be brief, the dataset consists of 2225 documents from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas, i.e., class Labels (business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, instead of using the raw dataset, we will utilised the pre-processed clean dataset we saved in our previous Activity 3 Generating Feature Vectors.\n",
    "Recall that at the end of Activity 3, we saved the pre-processed articles in a txt file named `bbcNews.txt`, where, each row is a document, with tokens seperated by whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continue, please make sure you have the following files in the same folder as this jupyter notebook:\n",
    "* `bbcNews.txt`: contains the pre-process BBC news articles\n",
    "* `labels.csv`: contains the label/class of each article."

    "## 4. Generating TF-Ijob_ad weighted document vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, I hope you have lots of fun building document embeddings based on varoius word embedding models. \n",
    "Previously, when we generate the document embeddings, we just sum up the embeddings vector of each tokenized word in the article, a bit simplicity 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, let's make it a bit more challenging, we are going to build the tf-ijob_ad document embeddings. \n",
    "What does that mean? 🤨\n",
    "Hmm~~ it's not magic, we just do a weigthed sum of the word embedding vectors, however, the weight here, refers to the tf-ijob_ad weight of the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you already forgot about what is `tf-ijob_ad`, please refer to Activity 3 Pre-processing Text and Generating Features. \n",
    "Otherwise, move on!\n",
    "So we've generated the tf-ijob_ad vector representation of documents in Activity 3 and saved in a txt file called `bbcNews_tVector.txt`. The format of this file is:\n",
    "- each line represents an article;\n",
    "- each line is of the format 'w_index:weight w_index:weight ......' \n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, but we don't have that word index `w_index` here in this activity, what should we do? 🤔\n",
    "ah ha, we also saved the vocabulary in a file `vocab`, in which each line is a word, and of the format `index,word`. \n",
    "Theresore, based on these two files, we can create a word:weight mapping for each tokenized word in a document!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, in the following couple block of codes, this is exactly what we are trying to do, step by step. \n",
    "- the `gen_vocIndex` function reads the the vocabulary file, and create an w_index:word dictionary"
