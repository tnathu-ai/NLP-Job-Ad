    "\n",
    "In the previous activity, we have demonstrated the basic steps of text pre-processing with the BBC News corpus. \n",
    "We have also saved all the tokenized text, the vocabulary and the generated data features in .txt files. \n",
    "In this activity, we are going to have a bit of fun buliding maching leaning models for document classification, using our generated data features. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "Same as in the previous activity, the document collection that we are going to use is the BBC News Dataset. For the origin of the dataset, please refer to the previous activity. \n",
    "To be brief, the dataset:\n",
    "* Consists of 2225 documents from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas from 2004-2005.\n",
    "* Class Labels: 5 (business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the raw text data from the dataset, in this activity, we will utilised the generated data features from the previous activity (and that's the reason why we put this two activities in the same folder  &#129322;). You must complete the previous activity before you start with this activity. Before you start, make sure you have the following files in the same folder as this Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "- `articles` folder consist of 2225 BBC News articles, each in a .txt file, named with its article ID (in a 4 digit format: '0001.txt' - '2225.txt'). This folder is obtained from the original dataset;\n",
    "- `labels.csv` is a csv file with two columns, one is the `Article ID` (in 4 digit format), and another is its corresponding class labels, i.e., one of the 5 (business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech). This file is from the original dataset;\n",
    "- `jobAd_bVector.txt` stores the binary vector representation in the format of `word_index:1` for words that appear in a document;\n",
    "- `jobAd_cVector.txt` stores the count vector representation in the format of `word_index:count` for words that appear in a document;\n",
    "- `jobAd_tVector.txt` stores the tfidf vector representation in the format of `word_index:weight` for words that appear in a document;\n",
    "- `jobAd_Webindexs.txt` stores the IDs of articles, with same indexes as the previous files storing the vector representations;\n",
    "- `jobAd_voc.txt` stores the vocabulary (as well as the index of each word).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start to do anything interesting, let's read the data first. \n",
    "We will first take a look at the lables and their distribution:"

    "### 1.1 Reconstructing the Vector Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in the previous activity, we have processed the BBC News articles, each converts to three vector representation: binary vector, count vector and tfidf vector. \n",
    "We have also saved these representations in files: \n",
    "* each line represents an article/document\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will have to read these pre-processed data and reconstruct the vector representation for each document, and thus, re-construct the matrix represenstation for the entire corpus that is ready for downstream analysis tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we defined two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `str2vec` takes a string (i.e. a line in a vector representation file), and the size of the vocabulary as inputs. It then constructs a document vector of the vocabulary size, process the string, and enters values (count/weight) into the relevant element of the document vector and returns the constructed document vector. \n",
    "* `vecF2matrix` takes the names of the files of the vector representation (e.g. `jobAd_bVector.txt`) and the size of vocabulary as inputs, then:\n",
    "    * it reads the vector representation file as a list of lines (one of each article), then constructs the matrix represenstation (list of lists, each row is an article, and each column is a word index) for the entire corpus\n",
    "    * finally, it convert the constructed sparse matrix into a CSR matrix representation using the `csr_matrix` function from `scipy.sparse`"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we have demonstrated how to build a simple logistic regression model for document classification, using the data features we created in our last activity, namely, binary, count, and tfidf vector representation of documents. \n",
    "A few message to take away:\n",
    "* it is not guaranteed that a more sohpicated model (e.g. the one built by tfidf vectors) can produced higher accuracy. See in some of our previous examples, binary and count might produce a higher score with a particular seed. \n",
    "* there are randomness that could happen in train-test split and in model bulding as well, so to make the result reproducible, remember to set a seed.\n",
    "* since there are randomness involved, it's more robust to validate a few times, and cross-validate is a common validation framework we can adopt to get more robust results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we hope you have a lot of fun doing this activity!!! &#129322;"
