    "    * 1.2.2. Tokenize each job advertisement description. The word tokenization must use the following regular expression:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    pattern = r\"[a-zA-Z]+(?:[-'][a-zA-Z]+)?\" \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    * 1.2.3. All the words must be converted into the lower case;\n",
    "    * 1.2.4. Remove words with length less than 2.\n",
    "    * 1.2.5. Remove stopwords using the provided stop words list (i.e, stopwords_en.txt). It is located inside the same downloaded folder.\n",
    "    * 1.2.6. Remove the word that appears only once in the document collection, based on term frequency.\n",
    "    * 1.2.7. Remove the top 50 most frequent words based on document frequency.\n",
    "    * 1.2.8. Save all job advertisement text and information in txt file(s) \n",
    "    * 1.2.9. Build a vocabulary of the cleaned job advertisement descriptions, save it in a txt file (please refer to the required output)\n",
    "    \n",

    "      \n",
    "+ 1.4. References\n",

    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "+ A small collection of job advertisement documents (around 776 jobs) inside the `data` folder.\n",
    "+ Inside the data folder, there are four different sub-folders: Accounting_Finance, Engineering, Healthcare_Nursing, and Sales, representing a job category.\n",
    "+ The job advertisement text documents of a particular category are in the corresponding sub-folder.\n",
    "+ Each job advertisement document is a txt file named `Job_<ID>.txt`. It contains the title, the webindex (some will also have information on the company name, some might not), and the full description of the job advertisement.\n",

Additionally, the vectors would also contain many 0s, thereby resulting in a sparse matrix (which is what we would like to avoid). We are retaining no information on the grammar of the sentences nor on the ordering of the words in the text.\n",

    ">> * The downstream analysis will determine how we should treat the text. Should we pre-process the `title` information if we put it into the classification model? Or ought we only concentrate on the `description` itself? Based on the analytical work's objectives, we can choose the appropriate downstream analysis task. For instance, we may use the whole document when doing tasks like document classification and clustering. In contrast, performing functions like document summary and information retrieval, a smaller unit, such as a paragraph or phrase, may be used."
